# NYC-housing-sales

## About the project
---
I combined and cleaned data from 4 different sources to plot an interactive map of New York City showing the housing sales prices. The details are documented along with the code in the Jupyter notebook file.

## Getting started
---
I used Jupyter notebook for this project. Run the `ipynb` file locally or open the `html` file to see the interactive map. \
To install Jupyter notebook, one can do so with [conda or pip](https://jupyter.org/install), but I found it neat to use the package management tool [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
