# NYC-housing-sales

## About the project
---
I combined and cleaned data from 4 different sources to plot an interactive map of New York City showing the housing sales prices. The details are documented along with the code in the Jupyter notebook file.

## Getting started
---
The project is done using Jupyter notebook. Run the notebook locally to interact with the map. \
One way to install Jupyter notebook is by using [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
